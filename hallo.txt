Mirroring a repository in another location
If you want to mirror a repository in another location, including getting updates from the original, you can clone a mirror and periodically push the changes.

Open Git Bash.

Create a bare mirrored clone of the repository.

git clone --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/repository-to-mirror.git
Set the push location to your mirror.

cd repository-to-mirror.git
git remote set-url --push origin https://github.com/exampleuser/mirrored
As with a bare clone, a mirrored clone includes all remote branches and tags, but all local references will be overwritten each time you fetch, so it will always be the same as the original repository. Setting the URL for pushes simplifies pushing to your mirror. To update your mirror, fetch updates and push.

git fetch -p origin
git push --mirror

Mirroring a repository that contains Git Large File Storage objects
Open Git Bash.

Create a bare clone of the repository. Replace the example username with the name of the person or organization who owns the repository, and replace the example repository name with the name of the repository you'd like to duplicate.

git clone --bare https://github.com/exampleuser/old-repository.git
Navigate to the repository you just cloned.

cd old-repository.git
Pull in the repository's Git Large File Storage objects.

git lfs fetch --all
Mirror-push to the new repository.

git push --mirror https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git
Push the repository's Git Large File Storage objects to your mirror.

git lfs push --all https://github.com/exampleuser/new-repository.git
Remove the temporary local repository you created in step 1.

cd ..
rm -rf old-repository.git
